    <strong class="question">What do the hedgehogs (and mice) eat?</strong>
    Through the summer we were originally giving them <a class="external" href="https://www.spikesfood.co.uk/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Spike's Hedgehog Food</a>. However, lots was being wasted and going off quickly. We switched to cat and dog biscuits when the Autumn came, of which we have now settled on <a class="external" href="https://www.purina.co.uk/cat/cat-food/product-go-cat-chicken-turkey" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Go Cat</a>
</p>
<p>
    <strong class="question">Where have the hedgehogs gone?</strong>
    If you are looking for footage from the winter months, there are few recordings of hedgehogs, as they are hibernating. They'll be back, and when they do footage will appear. In the meantime, check a previous month, or enjoy the mice!

<p>
    <strong class="question">Does more than one hedgehog ever visit?</strong>
    Lots of hedgehogs visit, but they usually come alone. However there have been some recordings of pairs, such as <a href="/footage?video=2022-09-29-22-33-34_Xbro-XC100_SecurityCam-20220929-222834@300490.mp4">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
    <strong class="question">Have baby hedgehogs (hoglets) been?</strong>
    Not yet, but they are more than welcome!
</p>
<p>
    <strong class="question">Why are there no videos for certain days?</strong>
    A few reasons really. Perhaps the camera batteries were all discharged, the cameras didn't record, or perhaps there were just no visitors.
</p>
<p>
    <strong class="question">How does footage get to the website?</strong>
    The process is part automated, part manual, and continues to evolve. A technical overview can be read <a class="external" href="https://www.mike-irving.co.uk/web-design-blog/?blogid=122" target="_blank">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
    <strong class="question">Why are the clips of different length?</strong>
    Each of the <a href="/cameras">cameras</a> records for a differing amount of time.
</p>
<p>
    <strong class="question">Why does the published clip time not match the overlaid video time?</strong>
    The 'clip' time shown is when the file has been fully created, so should match the final second time, or a few seconds after recording has finished.
